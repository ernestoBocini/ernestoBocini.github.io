# Hey, I'm Ernesto <span class="wave">ðŸ‘‹</span> 
Data Science Research Student at NLP Lab @EPFL<br>

---
I am a Master Student in Data Science and Machine Learning from EPFL, Switzerland. I am passionate about the field of Neuro-Machine Learning, I have done several projects using scientific libraries such as Pytorch, Scikit, Tensorflow etc. Winner of the "Best Undergraduate Project in Computer Science from Europe" at the Global Undergraduate Awards, Dublin 2022.

ðŸ§  NeuroAI Enthusiast: I am deeply fascinated by the mysteries of the brain and its intricate mechanisms. My curiosity drives me to dive into the world of Computational Neuroscience, where I aim to leverage data-driven approaches to unravel the brain's hidden secrets and contribute to advancements in neuroscience research.

ðŸ’» My Mission: I thrive on the challenge of leveraging data to build intelligent systems and predictive models. My expertise lies in deep learning for vision and graph neural networks, allowing me to transform raw data into actionable insights and create impactful solutions.

ðŸš€ Bridging Theory and Application: With a solid foundation in both theoretical knowledge and hands-on experience, I am committed to bridging the gap between research and real-world applications. Whether it's designing neural networks or analyzing neural data, I am passionate about creating tangible solutions that push the boundaries of both fields.
